# 🌸 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Iris Dataset

This project performs detailed exploratory data analysis on the classic **Iris flower dataset** using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

---

## 📁 Dataset
- The dataset was loaded using Seaborn's built-in Iris dataset.
- It contains 150 observations of iris flowers with 4 features:  
  `sepal_length`, `sepal_width`, `petal_length`, `petal_width`, and `species`.
